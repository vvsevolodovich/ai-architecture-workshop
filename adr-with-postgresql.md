**Title**: Database Selection for Food Delivery Application

**Status**: Accepted (but let's make it better!)

**Context**: Our food delivery application requires a scalable and efficient database to manage orders, restaurants, menus, and customer 
information. We need to select a suitable database system that meets our performance, scalability, and maintenance requirements.

**Problem**: As a team, we're struggling with the decision on which database to use for this project. We've got some experience with 
relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL but are not sure if they'll be sufficient for this application's needs.

**Requirements**:

* **Performance Requirements**:
	+ Handle up to 10,000 concurrent users
	+ Process an average of 100 orders per minute during peak hours
	+ Achieve a query response time of under 50ms for critical business logic queries
* **Scalability Requirements**:
	+ Support a minimum of 5x growth in database size and traffic over the next 2 years
	+ Handle a maximum of 10,000 concurrent connections without performance degradation
	+ Enable seamless vertical scaling with additional storage or compute resources
* **Maintenance Requirements**:
	+ Perform daily backups and rollbacks for data integrity and recovery purposes
	+ Implement monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues before they become critical
	+ Provide a secure and auditable environment for sensitive customer information

**Decision**: Based on initial research, we will consider three primary database options: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB (NoSQL). After 
weighing the pros and cons of each, we have decided to use **PostgreSQL** as our primary database. While it may not be the most cutting-edge 
option, its robustness, scalability, and community support make it a suitable choice for this project.

**Rationale**: The decision is based on the following factors:

* PostgreSQL's ability to meet or exceed the performance requirements outlined above
* Its robust concurrency control and scalability features, which align with the application's growth needs
* The availability of advanced features like views, stored procedures, and indexing, which will help implement complex business logic and 
reporting requirements
* The community support and resources available for PostgreSQL, which will facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting efforts

**Alternatives Considered**: We also considered MySQL as a potential database option. However, it was deemed less suitable due to its:

* **Performance Limitations**: MySQL might struggle with high concurrency and query complexity, potentially impacting application 
performance.
* **Scalability Concerns**: MySQL's lack of support for concurrent connections and limited scalability features made it a less 
appealing choice.

**Consequences**:

* **Potential Performance Degradation**: If PostgreSQL struggles to meet the performance requirements outlined above, we might need to 
revisit this decision or implement additional optimization strategies.
* **Limited Support for Real-Time Data Processing**: Without a more advanced NoSQL database like MongoDB or Apache Cassandra, we might need 
to implement additional tools or services to handle high-velocity data streams.

**Next Steps**:

* **Initial Development**: Proceed with implementing the food delivery application using PostgreSQL as our primary database.
* **Monitoring and Testing**: Keep an eye on performance and scalability concerns. Conduct load testing and monitoring to identify potential 
issues early on, and be prepared to revisit this decision if necessary.
